# Write a Python program that takes the **quantities of multiple items requested** and their corresponding **available stock**, and validates if the **entire order can be fulfilled**.

# ðŸ“¦ Logic:
# - If **all requested quantities** are **less than or equal to** their available stock â†’ Show: "All items in stock â€” Proceed to checkout."
# - If **any item exceeds** available stock â†’ Show: "Some items are out of stock â€” Cannot proceed."
